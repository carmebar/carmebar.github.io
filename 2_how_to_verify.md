Motivation
==========
As you may have noticed this blog is a git repository. From the many advantages this offers
the one I care the most is end-to-end integrity. You, the reader, can cryptographically check
that everything written in this blog was written by me (well, technically the person with access to the private signing key).

You can read more about the benefits and motivation of writting a git-based blog
on [this article](http://blog.invisiblethings.org/2015/02/09/my-new-git-based-blog.html) written by the always inspiring Joanna Rutkowska({% include icon-twitter.html username="rootkovska" %}), or at least someone who has access to her private keys.
